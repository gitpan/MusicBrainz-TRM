=head1 NAME

MusicBrainz::TRM - MusicBrainz TRM Acoustic Fingerprint API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MusicBrainz::TRM;

  my $trm = MusicBrainz::TRM->new();

  $trm->set_pcm_data_info($samples,$channels,$bits);
  $trm->set_song_length($seconds);

  while( (! $pcmfh->eof() && 
         (! $trm->generate_signature($pcmfh->getline()) );
  my $sig = $trm->finalize_signature();
  my $ascii_sig = $trm->convert_sig_to_ascii($sig) if( $sig);
  print "Signature: '", $ascii_sig, "'\n";


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides access to the musicbrainz client TRM API using a perl-ish
OO interface.

=head2 methods

=over 4


=item new


$trm = MusicBrainz::TRM->new();


Create a new MusicBrainz TRM object.


=item set_proxy

$trm->set_proxy($serverAddr, $serverPort);

Set the name of the HTTP Proxy to use to access the Internet.

=item set_pcm_data_info

$trm->set_pcm_data_info($samplesPerSecond, $numChannels, $bitsPerSample);

Called to set the type of audio being sent to be signatured.
This MUST be called before attempting to generate a signature.

=item set_song_length

$trm->set_song_length($seconds);

Called to set the total length of the song in seconds.  Optional, but if this
method is not used, generate_signature() will calculate the length of
the audio instead.  Must be called after set_pcm_data_info() but before
any calls to generate_signature().

=item generate_signature

$enough = $trm->generate_signature($pcm_data);

The main functionality of the TRM class.  Audio is passed to this method
and stored for analysis. set_pcm_data_info() needs to be called before
calling this method.  finalize_signature() needs to be called after
this method when generate_signature()  has returned a '1' or there is 
no more audio data to be passed in.

=item finalize_signature


$signature = $trm->finalize_signature();

$signature = $trm->finalize_signature($collectionId);


Used when there is no more audio data available or generate_signature() 
has returned a '1'.  This method finishes the  generation of a 
signature from the data already sent via generate_signature().

This method will access the Relatable signature server to generate 
the signature itself. Windows only: You will need to call $mb->WSAInit() before 
you can use this function. If your program already uses sockets, you will 
not need to call $mb->WSAInit and $mb->WSAStop from MusicBrainz::Client.
The $collectionID is an optional 16-byte string to associate the signature
with a particular collection in the Relatable Engine.  Generally this is
not needed.

The method will return undef on failure to generate the signature.

=item convert_sig_to_ascii

$ascii_sig = $trm->convert-sig_to_ascii($trm, $signature);

This translates the 16 character raw signature into a 36 character 
human-readable string containing only letters and numbers.  Used after 
generate_signature().
